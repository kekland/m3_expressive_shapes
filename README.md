# m3_expressive_shapes

Port of `androidx.graphics.shapes` and `compose.material3.MaterialShapes` to Flutter.

> [!NOTE]
> I'm not planning to publish this package on pub - currently I'm only using it internally for my own projects. @benthillerkus is also making a much more stable looking implementation in https://github.com/benthillerkus/m3_expressive_shapes.

Usage:

```yaml
m3_expressive_shapes:
  git:
    url: https://github.com/kekland/m3_expressive_shapes
```
